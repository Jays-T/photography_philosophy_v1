# Photography Philosophy deployed via Heroku at <a href="https://photography-philosophy.herokuapp.com/">LanthusClark.com</a>

* This project in its current state is purely for educational purposes. 
* There are some layout issues which will be addressed in the next update of the project. For example: Issues with the navbar, specifically on the landing page, not being set in place(sticky), some spacing and padding issues throughout the site, the large gap between the navbar and site content. Many of these layout issues were not properly addressed in the final rush to submit the project by the hard deadline (This is my submission for the Milestone 4 at Code Institute's Fullstack Developer course).

# My Strategy

For this project I focussed primarily on the backend. This involved a lot of learning as the project developed.
I did some initial wireframes for the landing page and how I wanted to setup the products display.
I planned on using a simple card scheme that I had seen used on other sites as well as the Boutique Ado project from Code Institute
I relied heavily on the Boutique Ado project while developing this project. I found that many times the reason that my code wasn't working
was due to a small typo, or forgetting to add a path to the urls.py etc. 

While the backend was my priority I did not want to skimp on the front end either, though in the end perhaps the admin_hub didn't quite realise
the full scope of what I had hoped to present with this project.

## Separate Branches 

Midway through the project I received feedback on my previous milestone with this excellent suggestion: "The next step of progress should be using separate branches for each feature implemented."
I realised that I had already implemented quite a few features, but I began using seperate branches for each feature straight away.
Using separate branches saved me when about 70% through the project I was testing adding/deleting products in the Admin. I deleted one product and my database corrupted
Some of the work I had done on the separate branch was gone after this happened. 
I was able to recover the project because I was working on a separate branch and while unfortunately I had to delete the database and re-add all the products
most of the project was still there and safe in the Master branch.

# User Interface

* Initial concept

<img src="/media/wireframes/milestone_4_wireframes.png"/>

* I didn't want to go full greyscale, but I also wanted to use lighter/calmer colors to allow the images that I would be using for the project to really pop against the background.
* I went with a light blue/green background
* For badges and the navigation area I went with a semi-transparent background
* I didn't want a thick border, and 1 px was too thick for what I wanted so I wrapped most of the elements with a very thin box-shadow to give the appearance of a thin border.

* Fonts

  * I used Lato for the site font

- [ ] Users to be able to rate items
- [ ] Users to be able to leave reviews on items purchased



# Scope

* This is a fully functional web store with Stripe in Test Mode
* No purchases from this version will be either charged or redeemed

# Information Architecture

* <img src="media/wireframes/L_C_Photography_DB_Schema.png"/>

# Defensive Design

* Defensive Design was implemented using Webhooks and Python Decorators from Django

## Checkout
* Webhook handlers were setup to handle generic events, send confirmation emails on payment intent succeeding with stripe, failures and possible user errors.

On an order, the handler will first clean any data in shipping_details. This is to ensure that if the user has updated their shipping details in the form, the app will correctly populate the shipping_details.
If the user has selected 'save info' the webhandler will check if it is an anonymous user,
If the user has an account and is not 'anonymous' the information in the form will be saved to that users account.

The handler will then set order exists to false and try to get the order details:
* shipping details from the form
* item details from the bag/cart
* payment intent from stripe input

It will try 5 times to do this with a 1 second delay between tries.
If the order exists it will trigger the confirmation email, send a HTTP response of 200

If this does not succeed then it will set order to none and attempt to pull the order from the cache
If this fails it will cancel the payment intent and send a HTTP response of 500 to stripe

If however it is successful in populating the order from the cache it will trigger the confirmation email and send a HTTP response of 200 to Stripe

## Add/Edit/Delete

Using Python decorator of @require_login
Also the Add/Edit/Delete functions are only available to SuperUsers. A SuperUser can only be created by Admin or another SuperUser

# Testing

* Testing was done regularly throughout the entire process 
* Each function was tested and re-tested
* Defensive Design was tested by manually adding endpoints from areas where access should not be allowed
* Testing done on checkouts/logins/logouts/admin_hub/profile using back and forward buttons, manually adding endpoints and urls
* Site navigation and links tested thoroughly, navigation breaks also tested using the back and forward buttons

* I began writing tests for the project but due to unforseen circumstances I ran out of time and only have 2 views tests in the home app simply asserting that the views return the correct template
* And one forms test in the checkout app making sure the relevant fields are set to required

* All HTML validated with <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">w3 validator</a>
  * The HTML validator returned errors due to the jinja templating used to structure the site
* All CSS validated with <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">w3 css validator</a>

* I used various code and syntax checkers during the entire process and before project submission

**Checkers Used**
* <a href="https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html">Python Syntax Checker</a>
* <a href="http://pep8online.com/">Python Checker</a>
* <a href="https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html">Esprima JavaScript Checker</a>

# Bugs

**Major Bugs**

* There was a major bug with the delete product function which caused all the products to be deleted instead of only one.
* This bug was caught during testing and has been removed/fixed. 

# Deployment

* This project and all project files are hosted on GitHub via my GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/Jays-T/photography_philosophy_v1" target="_blank"></a>
* I coded the project using GitPod as my development environment. 
* This project is also hosted and deployed with Heroku

## To run this application in a cloud-based environment, you can deploy the code to Heroku. This section assumes you have succeeded at running the application in your local environment first. This section also assumes that you have setup AWS to host your static + media files

* To deploy the project using Heroku
   1. Register an account at <a href="https://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>
   2. Go to Heroku site, login and create a new app. Set a name for this app and select the closest region.
   3. In the Deploy tab of your App dashboard in Heroku, choose Deployment method. I chose GitHub.
   4. In GitPod you'll need to install:
         dj_database_url, and psycopg2 in order to use Postgres from Heroku/ 
         and Gunicorn to act as a webserver
   5. Now create a requirements.txt file using the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt in the terminal.
   6. Create a Procfile and put this into the Procfile:  web: gunicorn photography_philosophy.wsgi:application
7. On the Resources tab, in the Add-ons field type Heroku Postgres select the Hobby Dev then click the Provision button.

8. After setting the Postgress database in your Heroku Dashboard, go to the Settings of your app and then Reveal Config Vars and set the values as follows:

(Copy the values from your env.py file and paste them into Heroku) 

| Key | Value |
| --- | ------ |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  |  <your_value> |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  |  <your_value> |
| DATABASE_URL  |  <your_value> |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS  |  <your_value> |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER  |  <your_value> |
| SECRET_KEY  |  <your_value> |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY  |  <your_value> |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY  |  <your_value> |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET  |  <your_value> |
| DEVELOPMENT  |  False |
| PRODUCTION  |  True |
| USE_AWS  |  True |

9. Set heroku to not collect the static files with command: Heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1 --app <your_app_name>
   Now Grab the DATABASE_URL link from Heroku's Config Vars as we gonna need it to migrate to the Heroku Postgres database.

10. Back in your code editor terminal, go to settings.py in photography_philosophy and in the databases URL variable comment out the sqlite3 from django and 
replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse and give it the database URL from Heroku.
## Do NOT commit or push to github or heroku at this point.

11. Now we're going to save the settings.py and in your terminal type

* python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run

check that all migrations show up properly then type:

* python3 manage.py makemigrations 

Now type into the terminal

* python3 manage.py migrate --plan 

Double check the migrations and then migrate

* python3 manage.py migrate

This should populate the heroku PostgreSQL database 

Create the superuser for the postgres database so you can have access to the django admin.

* python3 manage.py createsuperuser

Now we need to add the required data into the database 
## Must be done only in the following order:

* python3 manage.py loaddata categories
* python3 manage.py loaddata products

12. Now go back to settings.py in photography_philosophy and for your database environment variables put this:

if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }

Save settings.py

With everything set commit the changes, push to github and then:

From the Heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on the "Deploy" tab, then scroll down to the "Deployment method" section and select GitHub.

Use the GitHub link and type in the name of the repository and click the search button. Then connect the Heroku app to the desired GitHub repository.

On the Deployment Tab, scroll a bit further down to the "Manual Deploy" section, select the master branch then click "Deploy Branch".

Once your application is running, you may want to update the Deployment method from Manual to Automatic.

   
   13. From Heroku you can now click 'Open App'. If all steps were completed correctly the app should run successfully
   14. You can also access the app using this url type:  https://photography_philosophy.herokuapp.com/
   15. You can access the admin with your superuser credentials via https://photography_philosophy.herokuapp.com/admin
   16. To test SuperUser options use:

| User: | Password: |
| --- | --- |
| Super | 3RwWn5YDcF5RkTv |
## There are no differences between the currently deployed site and the development version at this time.

## To run the project locally

To clone this project from GitHub:

* Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
  1. In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository ( For this repository: https://github.com/Jays-T/photography_philosophy_v1.git ).
  2. In your local IDE open Git Bash.
  3. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  4. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
  5. The command should look like this:  git clone https://github.com/Jays-T/photography_philosophy_v1.git
  6. Press enter and your local clone will be created and the response should be something like this:
> * $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> * Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...
> * remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> * remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
